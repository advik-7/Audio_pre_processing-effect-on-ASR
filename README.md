**Audio Preprocessing Effects on ASR Models**

This repository explores various audio preprocessing techniques and their effects on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) performance. The primary goal is to investigate whether preprocessing, such as noise reduction, silence removal, or feature extraction, significantly enhances ASR model accuracy. Our experiments lead to the conclusion that while preprocessing can make minor improvements, the key to robust ASR performance lies in using stronger, well-fine-tuned models.

Project Overview
This project is an empirical study on how audio preprocessing steps affect ASR models. Preprocessing is a common first step in audio processing pipelines to enhance audio quality by:

Reducing noise,
Removing silence,
Adjusting sampling rates, and
Extracting useful features (e.g., MFCC).
Despite these efforts, we find that while preprocessing can help marginally, a high-performance ASR model fine-tuned on relevant data generally outperforms any improvements preprocessing alone can offer.

Preprocessing Techniques
The following preprocessing techniques were applied individually and in combination:

Noise Reduction: Reduces background noise to improve clarity.
Silence Removal: Removes silent intervals to reduce unnecessary input.
Resampling: Converts the audio to a standard sampling rate (16 kHz) for consistency.
Feature Extraction: Extracts Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), which are widely used in ASR tasks.
Experimentation
Experiments were conducted to analyze the performance of ASR models on both preprocessed and unprocessed audio data. We used open-source ASR models and tested the following scenarios:

Raw audio vs. noise-reduced audio
Audio with and without silence removal
Models trained on MFCCs vs. raw waveforms
Each model's word error rate (WER) and character error rate (CER) were evaluated across scenarios to measure the impact of each preprocessing method.

Conclusion
Our findings show that:

Basic ASR models (e.g., not fine-tuned on specific data) can benefit marginally from preprocessing steps.
High-performance ASR models (e.g., large pretrained models) exhibit resilience to variations in audio quality due to preprocessing.
Fine-tuning ASR models on domain-specific data significantly outweighs the benefits of preprocessing alone.
